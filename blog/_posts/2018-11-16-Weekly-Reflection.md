This week in Computer Science, we learned about function designs. There are 3 steps to fast functions. They are: 1) Create a contract, 2) Two examples, and 3) A defintion of variables. That was learned last Friday. Recently, we did value vs function defintions. Create 3 definitions that define your name, age, and eye color. (Define age 14), (define name Emmanuel), and (define eye color brown). What I just defined was age and function. We were also able to make comparisons to modeling and defining definitions and/or pictures.
