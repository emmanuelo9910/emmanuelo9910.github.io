For my weekly reflection, we are doing a flag project. The flag I am doing is the United Kingdom. It meausres at 1:2, the 1 inch is the height, while the 2 is the width. The U.K. is also known as the Union Jack because it is the Birtish flag. The official  designation is based on 1/30ths of the width (or height) of the flag. St.George's is 6/30ths of the width, the fimbriations to it are 2/30ths (1/15th) of the width. St Andrew's Cross is a total of 6/30ths (1/5th) of the width, measured perpendicularly to the diagonal. This is made up, in the top hoist corner, top to bottom, of 3/30ths white, 2/30ths red, 1/30th white. These dimensions apply regardless of the length of the flag. Various designs if the Union Jack have different heights and widths. The square variant, the 2:3 variant, and the 3:5 variant. I just wonder why the Union Jack changed so many times for 400 years.
