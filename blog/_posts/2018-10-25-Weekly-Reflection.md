To summarize what we did today, we did similiar things to Math. We have circles of evaluation that allows us to code different equations, expressions, and functions. Today in math, we were learning to create eqations instead of actually solving the problems as a group. For the whole week in Computer Science, we have been going on we Scheme to code shapes, numbers, intergers, and letters to get the real defintion of the function. By doing this, I have been able to find the different actions weScheme can do with its interactions side and definitions side. Algebra was all about constructing eqautions to reflect on word problems. Algebra and Compuer Science combined make the most extraordinary duo ever!
