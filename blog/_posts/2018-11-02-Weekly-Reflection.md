To summarize what we did this week, was making connections in computer science and algebra. What I mean by this is that we were able to define functions for their meanings. For example, "solid" is a string because anything with quotation marks is a string. An image is anything that is a shape is an image. Bitmap/url takes in a string and produces an image. The string needs to be a link to an image, which means it needs to end with an image. We also leanred we a contract is. A contract is an agreement between the function and the domain. If you learn the agreement, you use the function.
