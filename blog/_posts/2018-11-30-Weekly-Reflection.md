As my class took the midterm on Monday, we have to figure what our question means. I picked 16 because I couldn't figure out how to answer it. It asked which test case would test the function.The correct was A but I picked D. I didn't pick the correct answer because the question was a little wordy. B had the wrong answer because it had two differnt colors, red and green. C was both answer but obviously it's only one answer. A is the correct answer because it has the right function, values, and defintions.
