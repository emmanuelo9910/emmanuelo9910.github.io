This week in Computer Science, we are still working on our flags. This is a in process reflection to see what we're doing so far. With my UK flag, I'm coming good so far, I just need to add the outlining of the red and white cross. 
(overlay (rectangle 300 50 "solid" "red")
         (rectangle 50 200 "solid" "red")
         (rectangle 300 200 "solid" "blue"))
This is my coding for the UK Flag.
