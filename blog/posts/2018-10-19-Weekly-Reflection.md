Today for my fifth reflection, Mr.Alatta has allowed to create a flag of our choice for a mini project. I picked the U.S.A., the land of the free and home of the brave. Other people picked flags like the Soviet Union, Japan, and many more. By picking the U.S.A., it gives me a way to express that I am free. I hope to pass this project and get a 4 in Computer Science. God bless you, have a good day, and strive for greatness.
