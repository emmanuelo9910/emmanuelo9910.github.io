## Flag of United Kingdom by Emmanuel Otoo

## Describe your program

-   What country did you design for? _then delete this instruction_
-   What grade do you expect? _then delete this instruction_

The country I designed for this project was the United Kingdom. I expect a practitioner or a professional for this project and overall in computer science, a practitioner. With my flag, I used the overlay function, which gives me the ability to overlap shapes. I should have used put-image because that would have given me the ability to crop the rectangle edges on the corners. Being able to define the width and height of the flag taught me how properly shape it. I also used the rotate function to flip shapes around with the rectangles. 

## Current output
